## Description

This project is meant to help quickly view and update workforce information

When you start the application you will be asked where you want to go:

![workbase main page](/assets/images/workforce-start.png)

Each of these 3 choices allows you to add update or view information from that menu

![workbase menus](/assets/images/workbase-menus.png)

When you want you can view all the information entered into that view:

![employee information](/assets/images/employee-menu.png)

All of the information is entered into your mysql account so please remember to update the mysql connection information

I have also added sql creation files and a seeds file that will help you get the hang of the application before using any production data on it.

Thank you very much for choosing this App,
